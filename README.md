# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

This repository contains MATLAB code for implementing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a computational method used for optimization problems. PSO is inspired by the social behavior of birds and fish, where each particle adjusts its position based on its own experience and the experience of neighboring particles.

## Contents

- **[PSO_MS.m](PSO_MS.m)**: MATLAB script for Particle Swarm Optimization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB (for running the `.m` file)

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mincasurong/PSO.git
    cd PSO
    ```

2. Open `PSO_MS.m` in MATLAB and run it to execute the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm.

## Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

PSO is a population-based optimization technique where each individual, called a particle, represents a potential solution. The particles move through the solution space by updating their positions and velocities based on their own experience and the experience of their neighbors. The goal is to find the optimal solution by minimizing or maximizing a fitness function.

### Key Concepts

- **Particle Position**: Represents a potential solution in the search space.
- **Velocity**: Controls the direction and speed of the particle's movement.
- **Fitness Function**: Evaluates how close a given solution is to the optimum.

### Example

To run the PSO algorithm:
1. Open `PSO_MS.m` in MATLAB.
2. Modify the parameters as needed.
3. Run the script to find the optimal solution using PSO.
